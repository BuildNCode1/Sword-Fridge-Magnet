# Sword-Fridge-Magnet
This is a fridge magnet in the shape of a sword. When you attach it to a fridge (or any magnetic object,) it will look as if the blade of the sword is sticking into the surface.

For this project, you will require 2 neodymium magnets, 6mm by 5 mm.

Here is a picture of the completed print:
